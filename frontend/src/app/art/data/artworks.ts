    description: `**Academy of Fine Arts of Rome | Thesis Project**
Supervisor: Prof. Sergio Sarra

**Core Philosophy**
The title references Chaos Theory and the Butterfly Effect: "Small variations in initial conditions produce large variations in the long-term behavior of the system." Our small daily choices about plastic have catastrophic long-term consequences.

**The Problem of Scale**
Humans cannot truly visualize environmental statistics: 300 million tons of plastic produced annually (half for single-use), 91% never recycled, 273 million tons ending up in oceans and nature each year. The Great Pacific Garbage Patch spans 1.6 million km² — twice the size of Texas.

**The Artworks**
Five paintings named after the five oceans, each containing a garbage island: The Atlantic, The Pacific, The Indian, The Arctic, and The Southern. Acrylic painting on canvas with real plastic elements — single-use items personally collected from the streets of Rome.

**Origin Story**
The project began on Hormoz Island (southern Iran) — a remote island where, while camping under unpolluted stars, masses of garbage were discovered on the beach. Annual cleanup campaigns revealed ever-increasing waste, sparking this investigation into plastic's global impact.

**Artists Studied**
The thesis examines Vik Muniz (Pictures of Garbage at Jardim Gramacho landfill), Jason Dodge (Cut a Door in the Wolf at MACRO Rome), and Ashley Bickerton (Flotsam Series with ocean debris from Bali).

**UN Sustainable Development Goals**
Aligned with Goals 3, 6, 12, 13, 14, and 15 — addressing health, clean water, responsible consumption, climate action, and life below water and on land.`,

    description: `**Mid Night Sun 2020 - Photography Series**

We are all going through a period of difficulty. In this particular time, like everyone, I had a different experience of life. For some people like me, it was even harder—because not only was I in quarantine, but I was also very far from my family and friends.

But it was also a very interesting and powerful experience. In my absolute solitude, I began to see things differently.

When I had the idea for these photos, we were in difficult moments—everyone at home, and many of us were alone. The window of my room was the only real connection I had with the world. From that window, I could watch people passing by, children playing, people keeping their distance from one another, and the new way of life.

To pass those days, I always tried to keep myself busy. During the day, the room was bright and the lights were always on. But one afternoon, when I was really down with all the lights off, I saw something else. My window was giving me something I hadn't seen until that moment. Every afternoon, the shadows, the sunlight, and the images of the world entered my room. My window painted my walls with different shapes. Every afternoon, when I turned off the lights, my room became my darkroom—with all the images that were different each time. And I began to photograph.`,
